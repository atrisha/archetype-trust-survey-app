That's much better than just making $5 each. Increases both our chances. Thanks.",1,1

1,"I do not know what I'm going to do, so I have no hints on how to advise you on choosing ""in"" or ""out."" Though it would be beneficial for me to pick don't roll and hope you pick ""in"", I also like to give you a chance to gain some cash. Who knows? What's up? Good luck on your decision. Choose whatever. If you choose ""out,"" you get only $10 total. If you choose ""In,"" you can get $17 total instead of only $10. 7 bucks is a lot of money! Hey. OK I think that the best way for both of us to make a profit is for you to choose IN and for me to roll. That way we both make some money. There's no point in me not rolling because that would give you and me less profit. So I'm a roller if you're in ðŸ˜Š.",1,0

1,"If you choose IN the first round and then I will choose Don't Roll at first. I will get $14 but then after that I will choose roll each time after the 1st role. Chances are most likely you will get $12 and I will get only $10. I will the only take 7 rolls for you to get even with me. That way we both leave with a good amount of money. Hope you have a great evening and that this works out for both of us. ðŸ˜Š",0,1
1,"If you choose In I'll roll. Why? If you choose out, we walk out with $10 each. If you choose IN & I choose IN then both of us coin. So it's a compro-mise. By agreeing to this I guarantee myself more $ than risking you choose out. So if you choose out I get $10 ($5 diff.) if you choose in I get $15 vs. $19 ($4 diff.) that's why",1,1
