1,"Hey there! So, I’ve been thinking about our little game here. It’s interesting because I can’t really tell what you’re gonna choose, IN or OUT. If you choose OUT, we both get a guaranteed $5, which isn’t bad at all, right? But if you go for IN, things get a bit tricky for me. If I DON’T ROLL, I get $14, and you get nothing. But if I take the risk and ROLL, there’s a chance you could end up with $12, depending on what the die lands on. Honestly, if I were in your shoes, I'd just go for OUT. It guarantees both of us some money, and I’m all about keeping it safe. But I’m feeling a bit lucky today, so if you choose IN, I might just go for the roll! By the way, I’ve got plans for the weekend; maybe some BBQ if the weather holds up. What about you? Anyway, just wanted to share my thoughts. Let’s see what you decide!",1,0,3,7
1,"Hey there! 😊 So, I'm kinda thinking about the decisions we both have to make here. If A chooses IN, it's tricky for me. If I DON’T ROLL, I get a solid $14, but A gets nothing. If I ROLL, I'll get $10, and then A has a chance to get $0 or $12 based on the die roll. It's a bit of a gamble. What if A goes IN? I feel like it might be safer to DON’T ROLL and just grab that guaranteed $14. But then, A gets $0, and I kinda feel bad about that. But then again, if we roll, it'd be fairer to A depending on the die. 🤔 Anyway, as I think here, I just got this really good coffee, and I feel pretty energized. What about you? In short, I’d love to aim for a win-win here, but I'm leaning toward not rolling if A goes IN. What do you think? Let me know! 👍",1,0,0,0
1,"Hey A! 😊 Just wanted to drop you a quick note. So, I've been thinking about this IN and OUT choice you're gonna make. Honestly, if you’re feeling safe, OUT sounds like a solid way for both of us to make some money right away, right? 💵 5 bucks each isn’t bad! But if you’re going IN, I guess I’m just hoping for a lucky roll. I mean, who doesn’t love a little gamble sometimes? It's like rolling dice in a board game, except the stakes are real! 🎲 Not sure what you’re feeling – maybe you’ve got some strategy you’re working with? Counting on you to make the first move!
